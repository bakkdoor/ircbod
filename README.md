# ircbod
## Simple IRC bot library for the D programming language

`ircbod` is a simple library for writing IRC bots in D.

It's my first D project (I just started learning the language) but maybe someone might find this useful.
I could not find an existing D library for IRC bots and it was a good exercise as a newcomer to the language.

`ircbod` is licensed under BSD license (see LICENSE file).

The `IRCSocket` class was ported from: [the Ruby IRCSocket library](https://github.com/injekt/irc-socket).
